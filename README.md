Knowledge is happiness -> Summary: This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
get_next_line - Read Lines from File Descriptors

Welcome to the "get_next_line" project, a versatile function that allows you to read lines from various file descriptors. This project is a valuable addition to your C programming toolkit, designed to make reading and processing files line by line a breeze.
Key Features

* Efficient Line Reading: "get_next_line" efficiently reads lines from file descriptors, making it suitable for various file input scenarios.
* Multi-File Support: It can handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously, allowing you to read from multiple sources in a single program.
* No Buffer Size Limitation: Unlike some standard functions, "get_next_line" doesn't limit you to a specific buffer size, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
* Memory Management: This function handles memory allocation and deallocation, minimizing the risk of memory leaks.

Getting Started

To use "get_next_line," include the provided header file in your C code and call the function to read lines from a file descriptor. It returns one line at a time from the specified source.

#include "get_next_line.h"

int main() {
    int fd = open("sample.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    while (get_next_line(fd, &line) > 0) {
        // Process the line here
        printf("Read Line: %s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }

    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
